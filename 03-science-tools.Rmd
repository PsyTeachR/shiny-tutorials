This tutorial will show you how Shiny can also be used to build handy apps which can be used in research and teaching. As an example, we will be building a simple app which will help us calculate the [visual angle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_angle) of a stimulus. I'd recommend you complete the earlier Shiny tutorials ([Creating your first app](01-first-app.html) and [Data collection](data-input.html)) as we'll be building on that knowledge here.

This tutorial will also introduce [reactivity](https://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/understanding-reactivity.html), which refers to how the app will react to the user's input, and [shinydashboard](https://rstudio.github.io/shinydashboard/), a [package](defs.html#package) which lets us build much more visually pleasing and user-friendly Shiny apps.

# Try the Demo App

Try the simple [Visual Angle app](http://shiny.psy.gla.ac.uk/JackTaylor/VisualAngle/). You'll have something very similar built by the end of this tutorial.

# Setup

First of all, we'll need to install the necessary packages (especially `shinydashboard`), create our shiny project, and check everything runs okay...

## Install `shinydashboard`

This tutorial uses `shinydashboard`. If you've not already done so, install the latest version of `shinydashboard` with:

```{r, eval=F}
install.packages("shinydashboard")
```

## New Shiny Project

Create a new Shiny Web Application project, and name it something like, "Visual-Angle-Calculator". For a reminder of how to do this, have a look at [the Creating your First App](01-first-app.html) tutorial.

## Replace the default code

[As in the first tutorial](01-first-app.html#14_default_demo_app), this will display the code for the default demo app. Delete all of the default code, and replace it with the following (or download the scaffolding file below):

```{r, eval = F}
library(shiny)
library(shinydashboard)
library(tidyverse)

# function for calculating visual angle
get_va <- function(size, distance, approx=F){
  if (approx) {
    rad <- atan(size/distance)
  } else {
    rad <- 2*atan(size/(2*distance))
  }
  rad*(180/pi)  # radians to angle
}
# function for converting to consistent units (mm)
to_mm <- function(val, units){
  recode(
    units,
    "mm"=as.double(val),
    "cm"=as.double(val)*10,
    "inches"=as.double(val)*25.4
  )
}


ui <- dashboardPage(
  
  skin = "purple",
  
  dashboardHeader(),
  
  dashboardSidebar(),
  
  dashboardBody()
  
)

server <- function(input, output) {
  
  
  
}

shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)
```

<a href="scaffolding_files/03-science-tools/01-base.R" download><i class="fas fa-file-code" style="font-size:18px;">  Scaffolding file (.R)</i></a>

## Run the App

Click on Run App in the top right corner of the [source pane](defs.html#panes), or enter `shiny::runApp()` in the console. You'll notice that so far we just have an empty app.

# Building the UI - Basics

The `shinydashboard` [UI](defs.html#ui) consists of three main parts, given as arguments to the `dashboardPage()` function:

* the header, `dashboardHeader()`

* the sidebar, `dashboardSidebar()`

* the main body, `dashboardBody()`

## Choose a Skin

We'll start by choosing a skin for the app. In the `dashboardPage()` function, change `skin = "purple"` to a colour of your choice. To see all the available skin colours, see the [shinydashboard documentation](https://rstudio.github.io/shinydashboard/appearance.html). Run the app to see how this affects the app's appearance.

<a href="scaffolding_files/03-science-tools/02-change-skin.R" download><i class="fas fa-file-code" style="font-size:18px;">  Scaffolding file (.R)</i></a>

## Choose a Title

Next we'll choose a title for the app. In the `dashboardHeader()` function, enter `title = "My App Title"`. Run the app to see how this affects the app's appearance. Your title may be too long to display, in which case, [see here](https://rstudio.github.io/shinydashboard/appearance.html#long-titles).

<a href="scaffolding_files/03-science-tools/03-change-title.R" download><i class="fas fa-file-code" style="font-size:18px;">  Scaffolding file (.R)</i></a>

## Build the Sidebar

### Copy and Paste

Change the `dashboardSidebar()` function to include the `sidebarMenu()` argument like so:

```{r, eval=F}
dashboardSidebar(
  sidebarMenu(
    menuItem("Process Cats", tabName="felinetab", icon=icon("cat")),
    menuItem("Process Frogs", tabName="amphibiantab", icon=icon("frog"))
  )
)
```

Run the app to see how this affects the app's appearance.

The `sidebarMenu()` function tells`shinydashboard` to render a menu in the sidebar. Each `menuItem()` function then adds an item to that menu with desired text, name, and icon.

* The text is what the option will be displayed as to the user.

* The `tabName` will be used as a reference when building separate tabs later on.

* The icon is selected using [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/icons) names.

### Customise

* Change the menu items' text to read `"Stimulus Features"` and `"Results"` (Hint: so far the menu items are labelled `"Process Cats"` and `"Process Frogs"`, so replace this text with desired tab label).

* Change the `tabName`s to something appropriate, such as `"stim-features"` and `"results"`.

* Choose suitable icons for the menu options, such as `"cube"` and `"calculator"`. See [https://fontawesome.com/icons](https://fontawesome.com/icons) for a list of all available icon names.

<a href="scaffolding_files/03-science-tools/04-build-sidebar.R" download><i class="fas fa-file-code" style="font-size:18px;">  Scaffolding file (.R)</i></a>

# Building the UI - Body

By now your App should look something like this:

![](images/03-science-tools/01-bare-app.png)

The next step is to build the body for our tabs.

## Tab Items

The content for different tabs is created using the `tabItems()` function. Each tab is then described using the `tabItem()` function, embedded *inside* `tabItems()`.

Change the `dashboardBody()` function to include the `tabItems` function, and describe the stimulus features tab like so:

```{r, eval=F}
dashboardBody(
  tabItems(
    tabItem(
      tabName = "stim-features",
      fluidRow(
        # the tab's content will go in here
      )
    )
  )
)
```

Note that the `tabItem()` function "knows" which tab you are referring to because of the `tabName` argument, so make sure this matches the tab name you gave the stimulus features tab (above).

New tabs are created by giving additional `tabItem()` functions as arguments to `tabItems()`.

<a href="scaffolding_files/03-science-tools/05-tab-items.R" download><i class="fas fa-file-code" style="font-size:18px;">  Scaffolding file (.R)</i></a>

## Boxes

A distinctive feature of `shinydashboard` is [`boxes`](https://rstudio.github.io/shinydashboard/structure.html#boxes). These are a really easy way of organising your content in Shiny Apps. We can create a box using the `box()` argument, and putting it inside the `fluidRow()` function for the stimulus features tab.

Replace the section of your code that reads, `# the tab's content will go in here`, with the following:

```{r, eval=F}
box(
  width = 6,  # an integer between 1 and 12, where 1 is 1/12 of the possible width
  title = "Stimulus Size",
  numericInput("size", "Size", value=3.2, min=0.01, step=0.01, width="100%")
)
```

Your App's Stimulus Features tab should now look something like this:

![](images/03-science-tools/02-first-box.png)

<a href="scaffolding_files/03-science-tools/06-boxes.R"><i class="fas fa-file-code" style="font-size:18px;">  Scaffolding file (.R)</i></a>

## Box Content

Have another look at the [example app](http://shiny.psy.gla.ac.uk/JackTaylor/VisualAngle/). Let's include the drop-down menu that lets you select the measurement units for your Stimulus Size. Make sure to give "cm", "mm", and "inches" as options. Set the `inputId` argument to something like `"size_units"`. For a refresher, see [`selectInput()`](data-input.html#Data-Widgets) from the last tutorial.

<details>
<summary>Show Solution...</summary>
```{r, eval=F}
selectInput("size_units", "Units", c("cm", "mm", "inches"))
```
</details>
&nbsp;&nbsp;

<a href="scaffolding_files/03-science-tools/07-box-content.R" download><i class="fas fa-file-code" style="font-size:18px;">  Scaffolding file (.R)</i></a>

## Adding New Boxes

Let's add the next box on the Stimulus Features tab, which will be used to input the distance of the stimulus from the participant. After the bracket which closes the `box()` function for our stimulus size box, add a comma (and new line for neatness), and create another `box()`.

Most of the arguments can then be copied over, but make sure to change the `title`, and the `inputId` and `label` arguments for the user input.

<details>
<summary>Show Solution...</summary>
```{r, eval=F}
box(
  width = 6,  # an integer between 1 and 12, where 1 is 1/12 of the possible width
  title = "Stimulus Distance",
  numericInput("distance", "Distance", value=3.2, min=0.01, step=0.01, width="100%"),
  selectInput("distance_units", "Units", c("cm", "mm", "inches"))
)
```
</details>

# Server Logic

Now that we have our basic UI built, we want to calculate our reactive values, and then render the output in our app's results tab. Anything calculated after the app first initialises needs to be calculated in the [server](defs.html#server). These values are [*reactive*](defs.html#reactivity) in the sense that they *react* to the user's input. Reactivity is the most confusing thing about shiny, but also the coolest.

## Give the Features Consistent Units

Since the user could have theoretically given their stimulus' size in mm, but its distance in inches, the first step is to put these in consistent units. Thankfully, we have a handy `to_mm()` function, which takes two arguments: a numeric value, and its current units ("mm", "cm", "inches"). The function returns a single numeric value, which is the same value but in mm.

As an example:
```{r}
to_mm(29, "inches")
```

How Reactive Values work:

* Reactive values are essentially functions, which provide the current reactive value as output when evaluated (e.g. `myValue()`).

* The user's input is handily stored in a list object called `input`. Specific values can be extracted with `input$inputID`.

* Reactive values are assigned in the form `myValue <- reactive({ 2 * input$userNumber })`.

To get our stimulus size and distance values, we can add something like this to our server, referencing the user's values with the inputIDs we added in our UI:

```{r, eval=F}
stim_size <- reactive({
  to_mm(input$size, input$size_units)
})

stim_distance <- reactive({
  to_mm(input$distance, input$distance_units)
})
```

<a href="scaffolding_files/03-science-tools/09-consistent-units.R" download><i class="fas fa-file-code" style="font-size:18px;">  Scaffolding file (.R)</i></a>

## Calculate Visual Angle

We can now use these reactive values to calculate another reactive value, the visual angle of the stimulus:

```{r, eval=F}
visual_angle <- reactive({
  get_va(stim_size(), stim_distance())
})
```

<a href="scaffolding_files/03-science-tools/10-calculate-visual-angle" download><i class="fas fa-file-code" style="font-size:18px;">  Scaffolding file (.R)</i></a>

## Render Results Reactively

Now we have the visual angle calculated, we just need to show it to the user. To do this, there are a number of "render" functions, which allow us to render UI features reactively. For example, `renderPlot()` lets us show the user a reactively-rendered graph. These render functions work similarly to the `reactive()` function.

As we just want to show the user the output, we're going to render an [infoBox](https://rstudio.github.io/shinydashboard/structure.html#infobox) (similar to a valueBox), with the `renderInfoBox()` function.

```{r, eval=F}
output$results_box <- renderInfoBox({
  infoBox(
    "Visual Angle", paste0(visual_angle(), " degrees"),
    icon=icon("eye"), color="purple"
  )
})
```

<a href="scaffolding_files/03-science-tools/11-render-results-reactively.R" download><i class="fas fa-file-code" style="font-size:18px;">  Scaffolding file (.R)</i></a>

## Adding New Tabs' Content

If you run the app now, you'll notice that we get a whole lot of nothing on the results tab. This is because we've rendered the info box with our results, but we still need to say where we want to put it. Put a comma after the last tabItem, and add the following code.

```{r, eval=F}
tabItem(
  tabName = "results",
  fluidRow(
    infoBoxOutput("results_box"),
    tags$style("#results_box {width:100%;}")
  )
)
```

<p class="alert alert-info">Note: The `tags$style()` function is an example of inline css in our code. In this example we're styling our info box to have a width of 100%</p>

# Conclusion

They might seem confusing, but shiny and shinydashboard are great ways to create interactive apps to help solve common problems (or demonstrate difficult ideas) in Science, which require your users to have minimal or no coding experience in R. Shinydashboard in particular makes it easy to build a professional-looking and intuitive UI. Your shiny apps can work great as standalone applications, or can be [built into your packages](https://debruine.github.io/tutorials/packages.html) to provide a friendlier face to your users.

# Bonus Material

## Iterative UI Generation

This is something I planned on covering but didn't have enough time to include. Often I find that I want to build several very similar UI features. Rather than just copy and pasting the code, it's possible to build the elements iteratively. This can make your code much easier to read and debug. One way of doing this is with a `lapply()` loop:

```{r, eval=F}
lapply(1:15, function(i){
  box(
    width = 6,
    title = paste("Box Number", i, sep=" "),
    paste("Box ", i, "'s content will go here...", sep="")
  )
})
```

<a href="scaffolding_files/03-science-tools/13-iterative-ui.R" download><i class="fas fa-file-code" style="font-size:18px;">  Here's an example app that uses this method (.R)</i></a>
