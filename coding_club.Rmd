We will be building a Buzzfeed-style Quiz app using Shiny. This page will document our progress.

Coding club is meant to build coding skills in R, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. You don't need to have any experience apart from basic R. If you can complete the [intro shiny tutorial](01-first-app.html) then you should be fine.



## Setting Up the Framework 

2021-03-17 14:00 (GMT) [Zoom link](http://uofglasgow.zoom.us/j/93838448011)

1. Check out the [demo app](https://shiny.psy.gla.ac.uk/debruine/coding_club/)
1. Download the [template](https://github.com/debruine/shiny_template)
1. You can access the code for the final app at <https://github.com/PsyTeachR/shiny-tutorials/tree/master/coding_club>

In this first class, we:

* discussed the structure of a shiny app 
* edited the main tab to have a collapsible box for each question 
* added six custom image buttons for the first question
* wrote a functin to more easily set up a custom image button
* edited the www/custom.css file to remove the background and padding from the custom image buttons

To prep for the next meeting, I'd like you to:

* decide what your quiz theme and questions will be
* find images for each question ([Pixabay](https://pixabay.com) is a good site for open-access images)
* set up a few questions with image buttons
* Edit the info tab to include image citation information

The password for the [class recording](https://uofglasgow.zoom.us/rec/share/lTH8SniBrkm3PilcTG0I0_KlSNqVnWNelq_4A5vE-VQ9h9_IECoNHjfdo30of_q9.0UOkISRJLtYCX0wA) is on the coding club channel of the Methods and MetaScience Team. Contact Lisa to be added if you're at Glasgow, or to ask for the password if you're not.

You can download a zip file with the [code for our current progress](files/quiz1.zip).
